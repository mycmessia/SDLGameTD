# SDLGameTD
This is a tower defense game based on SDL.<br />
In this project, I use command pattern to implement the input command making it easy to change the command of different buttons.<br />
I use state pattern to build the player and enemy AI systems.<br />
The project is created by XCode so it is better to see it by that.<br />
There are also some XCode groups in the project classify these files.<br /><br />
Here is a screen shot of this game.<br />
