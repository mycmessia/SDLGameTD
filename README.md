# SDLGameTD
This is a tower defense game based on SDL and a good way to know the basic principles of 2D game engine.<br />
In this project, I implemented command pattern to handle the inputs making it easy to change the commands of different buttons.<br />
State pattern is used to build the player and enemy AI systems.<br />
The project is created by XCode so it is better to see it by that.<br />
There are also some XCode groups in the project which classify these files.<br />
Also I put the four SDL frameworks used in this project in a separate folder so you do not need to find them everywhere.<br />
If you are using a mac, just make sure you copy all the frameworks into the /Library/Frameworks folder.<br /><br />

Here is a screen shot of this game.<br />
